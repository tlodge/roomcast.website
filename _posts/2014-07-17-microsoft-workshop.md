    I’ll be adding to this post as we collect more minutes from the various participants.  Alex Taylor (Microsoft Research) kindly hosted a workshop at Microsoft’s Skype offices in the charming Waterhouse Square offices in Holborn.  We had a great turnout, with representation from Management Companies (Ballymore, Capco, Crabtree, Galleons Point Management),Housing Associations (Orbit Housing), Building Managers (Burrells Wharf), Residents, Broadband providers (Hyperoptic) and researchers.  I’ll be posting up slides/transcripts and observations soon.
