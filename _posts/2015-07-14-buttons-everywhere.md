    <p>In the last few days we've been hitting the road, demoing an early release of <strong>roomcast</strong>.  We tend to start by suggesting that there are many features of websites and property management systems and even day to day living that could be 'buttonised': i.e. accomplished by the press of a button.  One of the things that makes <strong> roomcast </strong> so elegant is that it can distill most wants and needs into a simple button press.  By doing this, we can keep the time between a resident needing something and being able to act upon it <i>effectively</i> to an absolute minimum. </p>

    <p> So what kinds of things can roomcast buttonise?  We've read through thousands of posts on many residental forums to figure out candidates.  We now have <strong>82</strong> examples of buttons that could exist in a residential development.  A button might simply serve up some up to date information, or it might perform an (arbitrarily complex) action.  </p>
