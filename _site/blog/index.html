This blog visits some of our design decisions and relates them to the underlying code used to support them. With <strong>roomcast</strong>, the communication system must make it easy for us to define groups of users in ways that makes sense to a residential development. There are lots of quite complex ways that we might reason about an intended recipient. Groups might be defined spatially : 'all... </p>

We tend to start by suggesting that there are many features of websites and property management systems and even day to day living that could be 'buttonised': i.e. accomplished by the press of a button. One of the things that makes <strong> roomcast </strong> so elegant is that it can distill most wants and needs into a simple button press. By doing this, we can keep the time between a resident needing... </p>

Buildings are complex structures. They have floors and apartments. Each apartment may or may not have a neighbouring apartment, and may or may not have apartments above and below it. When we were designing <strong>rooomcast</strong> we knew that it would be important to be able to talk about buildings in this way. We could imagine many a scenario where it would be useful to get information about an apartment's location in relation to other things in the building. So for example, it... </p>

    I’ll be adding to this post as we collect more minutes from the various participants.  Alex Taylor (Microsoft Research) kindly hosted a workshop at Microsoft’s Skype offices in the charming Waterhouse Square offices in Holborn.  We had a great turnout, with representation from Management Companies (Ballymore, Capco, Crabtree, Galleons Point Management),Housing Associations (Orbit Housing), Building Managers (Burrells Wharf), Residents, Broadband providers (Hyperoptic) and researchers.  I’ll be posting up slides/transcripts and observations soon.
