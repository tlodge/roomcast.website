 		<div class="about"><span class="emphasis">ROOMCAST is a brand new system that substantially improves and simplifies communication between residents and management. </span>It provides residents 
with a simple panel of buttons which send just the right information to just the right 
place or person. It is the product of two years of university-led research and over 
ten years of experience with residential communities. </div>

				<li class="benefit"> A beautifully <strong>simple interface </strong> that runs on <strong>any device</strong>.  Individual  residents are presented with only the buttons relevant to the services that they need.
				</li>
		
				<li class="benefit">
					Buttons completely <strong>eliminate the frustrations</strong> that come from figuring 
out who needs to be talked to, what information they need and what 
the process is. 
				</li>
		
				<li class="benefit">
					<strong>Instant feedback and tracking</strong> on all button presses. <strong>ROOMCAST</strong> can provide up to date information on the status of a button press and how long it will typically take to resolve.

				<li class="benefit"> <strong>ROOMCAST</strong> can use <strong>any communication channel.</strong> A button can send a text to security, an email to the building manager, popup a message on a dashboard and even send out messages to specific residents or owners.</li>
		
				<li class="benefit">
					<strong>ROOMCAST</strong>  is <strong>simple to use</strong>. With a small set of screens, management can track button presses, create new buttons and analyse statistics on a development. 
				</li>
		
				<li class="benefit">
					<strong>ROOMCAST</strong>  is powerful. It has been designed to <strong>work with other systems.</strong>  When a button is pressed it might interrogate a user's account, read sensors, send messages to neighbours, unlock a door, send a tweet, read the temperature of the pool, book a seat in the cinema or any other action we've not yet thought of! </li>

				<li class="benefit">
					<strong>ROOMCAST can earn</strong>. The button panel is yours to use as you see fit.  Buttons can be added that call out to affiliated local businesses:  florists, takeaways, estate agents, gyms etc. </li>
